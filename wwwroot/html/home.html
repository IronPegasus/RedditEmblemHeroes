<div>
    Angular is a one-page application, meaning that chunks of HTML are loaded into the same main HTML page.<br />
    Even though the URL is different, you really haven't gone anywhere.<br /><br />

    Angular can do lots of cool things, like run for-loops in HTML.<br />

    <ul>
       <li ng-repeat="item in myList">
           {{item}}
       </li>
    </ul>
</div>
